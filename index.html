      <h2 class="peta push-1-2">What is Ontario Wildlife Rescue all about?</h2>
      <p class="kilo push-1-2">Our primary goal is to connect people who have found injured or orphaned wild animals with those who can look after them and get them back into the wilds. Through a network of rehabilitators (government word for people who help wild animals) and wildlife rescue centres across Ontario we try to save as may wild animals as possible.</p>
      <p class="kilo push-1-2">The first 24 to 48 hours after a wild animal is found is the most critical. They usually have been without food or water for a while and are confused and afraid. Connecting with a wildlife professional quickly can save their life. Use this site to locate a wildlife rescue centre in your area or a centre that specializes in a particular species.</p>
      <p class="kilo">The second goal of Ontario Wildlife Rescue is to help raise money for wildlife rescue centres across Ontario. Rehabilitation and wildlife rescue centreâ€™s are not government funded in Ontario. They are completely dependent on donations and the public support. The smaller centres in particular do not have fundraising systems and spend most of their time and resources looking after animals. For them, even a few dollars can make all the difference. Click on the donate button to help wildlife rescue centres.</p>

        <p class="kilo push-1-2">New cases of raccoon strain rabies have been confirmed in the Hamilton area. These are the first cases in Ontario since 2005.</p>
        <p class="kilo push-1-2">The Ontario government is working closely with local public health units and municipal governments, as well as animal shelters, licensed wildlife trappers, wildlife custodians and animal control services, to manage rabies in wildlife.</p>
        <p class="kilo push-1-2">In response to confirmed cases of rabies, as well as part of planned operations, the Ontario government distributes baits for foxes, raccoons and skunks to eat. The bait contains a small package filled with a rabies vaccine that is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. This is called oral rabies vaccination.</p>
        <p class="kilo">In December 2015, rabies vaccine baiting took place in response to the positive raccoon rabies cases in the Hamilton area.</p>

        <p class="kilo push-1-2">Haliburton Forest is proud to announce the arrival of six new wolf pups !</p>
        <p class="kilo push-1-2">On Tuesday May 3rd 2016, Luna (our Alpha Female) did not show up for her usual social interactions with the rest of the pack. Even a small feeding did not entice her to show up! Our Wolf Centre staff noticed her conspicuous absence, and after 20 years of experience, we knew that this could only mean one thing. Not to mention that the timing was dead on: precisely 63 days after we observed mating in early-March, which is the gestation period for dogs and wolves we could expect to have another litter of pups.</p>
        <p class="kilo">On Wednesday May 4th, we mustered our crew of eight staff and divided into several groups to take care of our annual maintenance. This included cleaning the windows of the observation rooms, cutting trees that had fallen on the fence, collecting bones in the feeding area, and of course, searching for the newborn pups.</p>
